    <h4>What measures should you take? </h4>


    <p> The pandemic has uncovered the delicacy of the US operations industry. Producing delivery delays and brought freight stacking up in port terminals as well as in rail yards and distribution centers. Basic gear, such as steel trailers and truck undercarriage, is inaccessible, making circulation focuses foster profound accumulations.</p>
    <br><br><br><br>

    <h4>Dealing with late shipments</h4>
    <ol class= "solutionText" >
        <li>Communicate with the shipping company</li>
        <br>
        <li>Order locally or pickup</li>

    </ol>
    <br>  <br>
    <h4> FlexPort</h4>
    
    <ol style = "font-size: 20px;"> 
        <li> What are the guarantees that products will arrive in time?<br>There are no guarantees that products will arrive on time. When you are shipping internationally especially, there are so many complex processes and steps involved that at any point in time, something can happen to cause a delay (whether it's controllable or uncontrollable).<br> <br> </li>
        

        <li> Has there been a time where shipments have been delayed for other reasons than natural causes? <br> 
         <ul>
            <li> - Trucker is having a mechanical problem, maybe the truck broke down</li>
            <li> - There is a chassis shortage at the port (nothing to put the container on for the trucker to transport the container to where it needs to go)</li>
            <li> - There is an equipment shortage, meaning no empty containers available to put your shipment in</li>
            <li> - Port strike</li>
            <li> - Trucker strike</li>
            <li> - There is nowhere for the vessel to berth so it has to wait at anchor until a spot becomes available for the vessel to unload its containers (this has been a HUGE cause of delay over the past year at the LA/Long Beach port) </li>
            <li> - Delay in customs clearance, maybe the customs broker doesn't have all the required documents from the customer to clear customs</li>
            <li> - The container is currently stored in an inaccessible area at the port so we have to wait for the port terminal to move it to an area where it can be picked up by a trucker</li>
            <li> - Shortage of workers unloading containers from vessels (can happen if there is a COVID outbreak) </li>
        </ul> <br> </li>
        <li> If everyone were to use the Flexport system will the threats of supply chains and shipment time decrease? <br> It could possibly decrease shipment delivery time a little bit as we use data to optimize the experience for our customers, so we are able to be proactive in situations where the delays are controllable. However, there are many uncontrollable situations that cause delays. Flexport is a freight forwarder and customs broker, and doesn't own vessels or ports or trucks, so our efficiency is dependent on the efficiency of the partners we work with. <br> <br> </li>
        <li>What changes in the economy can we expect with this system? <br> The goal of this system is to make global trade easier for everyone.</li>
