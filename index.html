    <h4> Are packages being delivered late? Noticed the lack of products in stores? 
    </h4>

    <p> You are not alone. In recent years we have seen problems with supply and demand. The reason behind it is simple. Products travel through land or sea for more efficiency. This has completely changed with the current pandemic. From 2020 to now we faced one of the most impactful global supply chains. The demand for products raised at the peak of the pandemic. Products like toilet paper and Lysol sprays. Through the years we have faced long waits for packages. To the point of a ship stuck in one of the most transited canals. This has impacted everyone globally, not only in America.

    <p>Some may think, this doesn't impact me because I don't shop online. This is the complete opposite, targeting our economy. The disruption of the market brings higher prices. The multiple variants: Delta, Omicron, Flurona, etc. We must work together to find a solution and combat this issue. The quantity of new COVID-19 cases has begun to decline, limit imperatives and work deficiencies should facilitate. Doing so will strain off supply chains and conveyance times. A few specialists expect that there's probably not going to be quick help from inventory network disturbances. Raised requests during the Christmas season in a portion of the world's biggest economies, one more rush of new COVID-19 cases, and outrageous climate occasions, assuming they emerge, could cause inventory network disturbances..</p>
