    <h4> Are packages being delivered late? Noticed the lack of products in stores? 
    </h4>

    <p> You are not alone. In recent years we have seen problems with supply and demand. The reason behind it is simple. Products travel through land or sea for more efficiency. Yet this has completely changed with the current pandemic. From 2020 to now we faced one of the most impactful global supply chains. The demand for products raised at the peak of the pandemic whether it was toilet paper or lysol sprays. Within three years we have faced long waits for packages to a ship stuck in one of the most transited canals. This has impacted everyone, not only NYC or LA but all countries.

    <p>We may think, this doesn't impact me because I don't shop online. However, this is the complete opposite, it has targeted our economy. The disruption of the market brings higher prices. With the multiple variants, Delta, Omicron, Flurona, etc. Now, we must work together to find a solution and combat this issue. When the quantity of new COVID-19 cases begins to decline, limit imperatives and work deficiencies should ease, taking a portion of the strain off supply chains and conveyance times. In any case, a few specialists accept that there's probably not going to be quick help from inventory network disturbances. Raised requests during the Christmas season in a portion of the world's biggest economies, one more rush of new COVID-19 cases, and outrageous climate occasions, assuming they emerge, could cause inventory network disturbances.</p>
