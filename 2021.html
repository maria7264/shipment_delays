    <p>The supply network is clogged. Last spring, shipments from China were a dribble. As they snapped back after the first to recover from the health crisis. Reports by Supply Chain Management Review attest to imports from Asia to the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, California, increased 22% from a year earlier. But containers started to pill up at the ports. Due to the lack of employees. There were no workers to store and move the cargo. The congested ports increased the time it takes truckers to drop off or pick up containers.  </p>

   <p> During the coronavirus outbreak, and the holidays approaching the number of overcrowded cargo ships became higher. The port traffic strangled the economy in America. Container delays have become both a symptom and a cause of global supply chain issues. But, looking back, freight has typically moved more easily and cheaply since cargo arrived, making them nearly crucial to the global economy.
