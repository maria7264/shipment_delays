    <p>The supply network, meanwhile, is clogged. Last spring, shipments from China dwindled to a dribble. They’re snapping back after that country was among the first to recover from the health crisis. In August and September, imports from Asia to the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, California, increased 22% from a year earlier, according to Supply Chain Management Review. But containers are piling up at the ports, which don’t have the workers to store and move them, the trade publication says. The congested ports have increased the time it takes truckers to drop off or pick up containers.  </p>

   <p> During the coronavirus outbreak, and with the holidays approaching, overcrowded cargo ships have become stalled in port traffic, strangling the economy. Container delays have become both a symptom and a cause of global supply chain issues. But, looking back, freight has typically moved more easily and cheaply since these enormous boxes arrived, making them nearly crucial to the global economy.</p>
